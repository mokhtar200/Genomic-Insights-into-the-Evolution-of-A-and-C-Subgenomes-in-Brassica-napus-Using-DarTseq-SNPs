# Genomic Insights into the Evolution of A and C Subgenomes in Brassica napus

Genomic Insights into the Evolution of A and C Subgenomes in Brassica napus Using DArTseq SNPs
________________________________________
Abstract
Polyploidy is a major driver of plant genome evolution and crop adaptation. We investigated evolutionary differences between the A and C subgenomes of Brassica napus using high-resolution DArTseq SNP genotyping in 186 globally diverse accessions. Stringent filtering yielded 4,434 high-quality SNPs (2,010 A, 2,424 C). The C subgenome exhibited consistently—across all metrics—higher nucleotide diversity, slower linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay, and a greater number of candidate selection sweeps than A. Genome-wide sliding window analyses and Manhattan plots reveal complex, asymmetric evolutionary dynamics at the subgenome level, with implications for crop improvement and fundamental polyploidy research.

Introduction
Polyploidization has profoundly shaped plant genomes and agriculture. As a recent allotetraploid (AACC, 2n=38), Brassica napus formed by hybridization of B. rapa (A, 2n=20) and B. oleracea (C, 2n=18), providing a natural model for subgenome evolution. Previous work has identified subgenome-biased expression and selection, but a high-resolution, population genomic perspective using globally representative diversity panels has been lacking. This study uses DArTseq SNPs and population genetic methods to reveal the evolutionary fates of the A and C subgenomes in B. napus, resolving genomic diversity, recombination, and selection signatures.

Figure 1. Distribution of Window-based Nucleotide Diversity
These histograms show the distribution of local nucleotide diversity (π) across the genome for each subgenome. The C subgenome (blue) maintains a broader and higher diversity, supporting a history of milder bottlenecks or balancing selection, while the A subgenome (red) shows a narrower, lower-diversity profile—likely resulting from stronger selective sweeps or population constriction.

Figure 2. Mean Nucleotide Diversity Comparison
The barplot visualizes the statistically significant (p = 5.09×10⁻⁵) difference in mean nucleotide diversity between subgenomes, with the C subgenome consistently showing higher genetic diversity. This suggests greater effective population size or lower intensity of purifying selection in the C subgenome since allopolyploid formation.

Figure 3. Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Decay
LD decay curves reveal contrasting recombination dynamics; the C subgenome maintains higher LD over greater distances, possibly reflecting larger haplotype blocks, reduced recombination, or more recent selective sweeps. These differences have practical implications for marker selection and mapping power in breeding.

Figure 4. Nucleotide Diversity Distribution—Density, Box, Violin Plots
multi-panel visualizations confirm that the C subgenome harbors both greater mean and variance in nucleotide diversity. The right-shift and wider spread suggest that the C subgenome retained more ancestral variation and thus may hold a richer reservoir of adaptive alleles.

Figure 5. Selection Sweep Detection—Manhattan Plot
Manhattan plots display –log₁₀(π) for sliding windows across chromosomes, visualizing genomic regions under selection. The A subgenome shows fewer, sharper valleys (classical sweeps), while the C subgenome has more frequent, distributed valleys (possibly "soft" or recent sweeps), revealing distinct evolutionary and selection dynamics.

Discussion
Our analyses reveal that B. napus subgenomes follow asymmetric evolutionary trajectories. The C subgenome has greater average and local nucleotide diversity, slower LD decay, and more sweeping regions indicative of recent or balancing selection. These patterns likely result from differences in effective population size, historical selection, and possibly introgression events. High C subgenome diversity offers opportunities for discovery of beneficial alleles; the unique sweep landscape of each subgenome should inform genomic selection and breeding strategies in oilseed rape.

Conclusions
This comprehensive population genomic analysis leveraging high-density DArTseq SNP data provides unprecedented resolution into the evolutionary dynamics of the A and C subgenomes in Brassica napus. Our results reveal that the C subgenome consistently retains higher nucleotide diversity, slower LD decay, and a greater number of candidate selective sweep signatures than the A subgenome. These findings corroborate a growing body of research demonstrating repeatable patterns of subgenome dominance and asymmetry following allopolyploid formation.
The greater diversity and broader sweep landscape in the C subgenome reflect both legacy effects of parental genomic architecture and ongoing evolutionary processes such as balancing selection, gene flow, and differential adaptation to agricultural environments. The A subgenome, by contrast, displays more pronounced, sharper sweep regions and a narrower diversity profile, indicating strong directional selection possibly linked to domestication traits or agronomic improvement. Epigenetic factors—including methylation biases and repeat element distributions—likely further reinforce the distinct evolutionary trajectories of each subgenome, as shown in recent genome-wide studies.
Importantly, our genome-wide sliding window and Manhattan plot analyses provide not only statistical confirmation but also visual evidence for this asymmetry, which has direct consequences for the design of breeding strategies and the management of genetic resources. The concentration of sweeps on certain chromosomes (e.g., C09, A02) highlights priority targets for functional genomics and trait improvement, while the broader diversity in the C subgenome marks it as a particularly rich reservoir for beneficial alleles underlying stress tolerance, seed development, and other adaptive traits.
Our findings reinforce the idea that polyploid evolution in crops like B. napus is not random or purely neutral, but shaped by pre-existing parental genome differences, ecological adaptation, and selection history. Subgenome interactions, gene expression dominance, and epigenomic remodeling all contribute to rapid, repeatable shifts in genome structure and function after allopolyploidization.
For breeders and crop scientists, these insights indicate that maximizing future genetic gain in B. napus requires targeted exploration and utilization of C subgenome diversity, careful monitoring of sweep regions, and subgenome-aware strategies for genomic selection and genome editing. Beyond applied breeding, our study provides a template for comparative polyploid evolution research in other plants, where subgenome-specific analyses can uncover hidden genetic resources and evolutionary principles.
In summary, this work demonstrates:
•	Subgenome asymmetry in diversity, selection, and recombination is a persistent, reproducible feature of B. napus evolution.
•	The C subgenome offers a wider genetic landscape for selection and crop improvement.
•	Integrated population genomics and functional analyses are critical to unlocking the potential of polyploid crops.
•	Future studies should further dissect the molecular and ecological bases of subgenome dominance, including the roles of expression bias, epigenetic regulation, and genotype-environment interactions.
These advances will have broad implications for both basic evolutionary biology and the sustainable improvement of major crops in a rapidly changing agricultural context.
