# Data Folder

This folder contains only *documentation* and descriptions regarding the data used in the project.

**Raw DArTseq genomic data and phenotypic data are NOT uploaded due to size and privacy restrictions.**

### Data Types Used:
- **SNP genotype matrix** (CSV)
- **Chromosome/SNP mapping file** (CSV)
- **Phenotype metadata table** (CSV)

### To obtain the data:
- Please contact the corresponding author or access via [external repository/DOI].
- Data format examples and required structure included below.

## Sample file descriptions:
- `Report_DBr25-10636_SNP_2.csv`: Raw SNP genotype scores matrix
- `Report_DBr25-10636_SNP_mapping_2.csv`: SNP mapping annotation
- `phenotype_clean.csv`: Cleaned sample metadata (accession code, country, etc.)
